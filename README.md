## Fake-News-Detection
Machine learning And 
Natural Language Processing) combination project!

# 📌 Project Overview
The widespread dissemination of misinformation and fake news has become a critical issue in today's digital world. To address this challenge, this project presents a Fake News Detection System built using machine learning techniques and deployed as a Flask-based web application.

The core functionality of the system is to classify input news articles as either FAKE or REAL, helping users identify potentially misleading information. This is achieved using a Passive Aggressive Classifier, a suitable model for large-scale text classification, in combination with TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction from text data.

# Tools and Technologies:

* **Python** for data processing and machine learning logic
* **Flask** to serve the web application
* **Scikit-learn** for model training and text vectorization
* **HTML/CSS** for the front-end interface
